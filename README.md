# Intro to python 

The repository is meant as a refreshment for the self-study students did for the Workshop 1 for the [UNIGIS master program](https://vu.nl/en/education/master/geographical-information-sciences) in July 2024. 

We browse go through some highlights from the [Data Analysis and Visualization in Python for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/index.html) lessons.

This will ensure that the students get familiar with the Carpentries style and prepare them for the [Geospatial python course](https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/geospatial-python/).
